# Alien Invasion

This is a simplistic space shooter made using Pycharm and Pygame for a class project, based on Eric Matthes's "Python Crash Course."

Sprites are taken from the book resources themselves. All music and sounds are sourced from OpenGameArt.org, although their file name had to be altered for code implementation.
